            GOALS
    =====================
    /*  PROGRESS: Projectile type and isAttacking is updated from time of input,
        until received by Logic class. HAVE YET TO WORK OUT HOW TO HANDLE
        PROJECTILE COLLISIONS. (Implement in server? Then how does user animate?)
         (Implement in user? Then how does server share info with other users?)*/


MED - Add projectiles (fireball/watergun/razorleaf)
MED - Add combat system:
        + Players should be able to perform melee attacks while moving (currently cannot)
        + Players should be able to fire a projectile in their current direction (server handles collision?)
        + Players should have an energy bar for attacks (cooldown system)
        = Idea: Attacks have elements and can destroy projectiles of the weaker element
MED - Add chat bubble system
MED - Smooth out player movement (smaller walk steps)

LOW - Add mob system with AI controlled by server thread
LOW - Add timeout-based disconnects (no packets received for 5-10 seconds)
LOW - Interpolate other player positions (if isMoving, then increment pos by 1 or 2 in their direction)
LOW - Add documentation to majority of code
LOW - Update character size when window size changes
LOW - For each packet the server receives (contains x, y), use a quad tree to determine which players to send update packets to
LOW - Change packets to store timeslices (multiple changes in one packet)
LOW - Add elevation system to maps (will reverse a new level system)



    ====================
            BUGS
    ====================
* Rendering of left-directed animations should be offset to appear as thought the character is moving




    ====================
            DONE
    ====================

CRITICAL - Add camera bounds
CRITICAL - Fix multiplayer login issue (Third user causes disconnects/client to malfunction)
CRITICAL - Fix focus transfer with chat system
CRITICAL - Implement chat system and text transfer

HIGH - Add idle frames for all players (reversed order of walk animation)
HIGH - Added rendering functionality of attack animations
HIGH - Add version numbers to game
HIGH - Implement collision system (Collision tile should be stored in X-1,Y (if lower left corner is origin))
HIGH - Add map bounds
HIGH - Allow for Server IP entry via dialog box if 'becoming host' is declined
HIGH - Integrate initial position and type with login packet
HIGH - Add Mouse input to remove chat window

MED - Make collision bounds controllable via Config class
MED - Show username above player characters
MED - Implement character change
MED - Implement player direction and animation in packets
MED - Add focus system for input handling via UI and game
MED - Fix username clashes

LOW - Adjust player collision bounds for consistency and smoothness
LOW - Update ServerThread to use UserList data structure for storing Players
LOW - Standardise packet transfer types to integer
LOW - Add readme.md to git repository
LOW - Sanitize username input

    =====================
            FIXED
    =====================
* Fix bug where non-server player cannot change characters (temporary change, then revert back to charmander)
* Certain messages cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (possibly linked with comma text removal issue)
* Text input after a comma (,) is lost for message sending
* Not all of the font's characters are being typed
